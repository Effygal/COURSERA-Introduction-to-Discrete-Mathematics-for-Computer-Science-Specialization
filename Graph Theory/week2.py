In this notebook, we'll implement a program that we'll solve the Guarini puzzle in blink of an eye!

Before starting to implement, let's agree on the following representation of a configuration. First, let's enumerate the eight essential cells of a 3x3 board as follows:


By a configuration we mean a placement of two white and two black knight on this board. We will represent it as a string of length eight. Its i-th symbol is equal to "*", if there is no knight in the i-th cell of the board. It is equal to "B" or "W", if the i-th cell contains a black or white knight, respectively. See an example below.

We now start creating the graph of all configurations. Below, we iterate through all possible strings of length 8 with two W's and two B's. For this, we iterate through all possible four indices of W's and B's (out of eight possible positions).
